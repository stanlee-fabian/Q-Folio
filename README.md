# Q-Folio
QOAO-based approach that optimizes ESG investment portfolio management through quantum computing principles. Q-Folio leveraged Quantum Rings to simulate quantum circuits and execute variational algorithms for selecting companies with optimal ESG scores and financial evaluations.

Key Highlights:
- Utilized QAOA to construct a quantum circuit that encodes ESG-based Hamiltonians.
- Integrated ESG scores and company valuations into Pauli operators for quantum measurement.
- Applied scipy.optimize.minimize (COBYLA method) for parameter optimization.
- Simulated quantum circuit execution on Quantum Rings' "Scarlet Quantum Rings" backend.
- Filtered unreliable data and calculated company-specific energy states, identifying the most sustainable and financially viable investments.

Our work crafted in just 48 hours showcases the potential of quantum-inspired techniques in responsible investing, bridging the gap between quantum computing and sustainable finance.
